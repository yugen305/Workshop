init
git init is used to create a repository

status
git status tells us the state of our working directory

Add
git add tells git to track specific files or folders
To stage certain changes with Patch Mode, we use git add -p

ignoring things
.gitignore files tell git what to completely ignore

commit logs
git log shows us all the commits that were made
git log --oneline shows a summary of all commits

diffs
git diff <old commit> <new commit> givesthe difference between two commits

commits
We can commit selected changes by using git commit -p


Branches
Git branches are like different universes we can experiment in
git branch shows all our branches
To create a new branch, use git branch <name>

Checkout
git checkout <branch name> switches to the branch
Branches aren't automatically updated
git checkout shifts the HEAD pointer around
We can visit an older commit using checkout <commit>

Merging
To merge changes from one branch into the another use git merge <branch name>
conflicts occur if we make changes that git can't automatically combine.
To fix a conflict, edit the file to be the way we want, then save and commit.

Undoing things
To replace a single file with an older version, use git checkout <commit> <file>
To undo and entire commit, git revert <commit>

Git reset can be used to undo commits: git reset <commit> --<mode>
In --hard mode, reset rolld back to the commit and DROPS ALL CHANGES since then
